- Give the adventurer 3 health points total
- Make the enemies shoot arrows that take 1 health off everytime the adventurer is hit
- Make a survivor against the back wall you must touch and tell the way out is clear
- Make the survivor de-render after saving him (touching his hitbox)
- Make doors in the dungon wall that take you to the next room

## Potential Roadblocks
